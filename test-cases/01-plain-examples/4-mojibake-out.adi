File with both ISO characters and UTF-8 characters. Field counts in bytes.

This is a common "mojibake" scenario where an app that uses ISO internally
has received UTF-8 byte streams.

It even includes a single field with both ISO and UTF-8 characters.

Command: `transadif {filename}`

Output should be transcoded to Unicode and correct field counts in characters.
