File with both ISO characters and UTF-8 characters. Field counts in bytes.

This is a less common "mojibake" scenario where data has been
reinterpreted from UTF-8 to ISO-8859-1 then converted to UTF-8
and reinterpreted again.

It even includes a single field with both ISO and UTF-8 characters.

Command: `transadif {filename}`

Output should be transcoded to Unicode and correct field counts in characters.
