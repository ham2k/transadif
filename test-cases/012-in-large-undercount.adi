UTF-8 file with large undercount if read as ISO-8859-1

Command: `transadif {filename}`

Field counts are in bytes, but the data contains UTF-8 sequences.
Expected output should change the field count for "name" to characters.

By including complex emoji, we try to go past the entire "<qso_date...>" field.

Each 1︝⃣ is 3 code points and 7 bytes in UTF-8. The 😜 emoji is 1 code point and 4 bytes in UTF-8.
So field count is 16 Unicode characters but 39 bytes.
