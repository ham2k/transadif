UTF-8 file with large undercount if read as ISO-8859-1

Command: `transadif {filename}`

Field counts are in bytes, but the data contains UTF-8 sequences.
Expected output should change the field count for "name" to characters.

By including a long Unicode name, we try to go past the entire "<qso_date...>" field.

The name includes 31 unicode characters that corresponds to 78 bytes in UTF-8.
