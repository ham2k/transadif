ISO-8859-1 file with large overcount if read as UTF-8

Command: `transadif {filename}`

Field counts are in bytes, but the data contains UTF-8 sequences.
Expected output should change the field count for "name" to characters.

By including a long Unicode name, we try to see if the parser truncates data.

The name includes 31 unicode characters that corresponds to 78 bytes in UTF-8.
