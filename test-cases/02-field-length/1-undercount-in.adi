UTF-8 file with undercount (field with count less than characters until next field) if read as ISO-8859-1

Command: `transadif {filename}`

Field counts are in bytes, but the data contains UTF-8 sequences.
Expected output should reinterpret the field, not truncate it, and correctly export it as UTF
