ISO-8859-1 file with overcount (field with count greater than characters until next field) if read as UTF-8

Command: `transadif {filename}`

Field counts are in bytes, but the data contains UTF-8 sequences.
Expected output should change the field count for "name" to characters and not read past the next field.

By including three accented characters, we try to go past the CRLF in the `excessdata` for the "name" field.
